Write a class for cyclic two-way list (of integers).
Class should allow to:
1. Add elements (at the beginning, after certain element, at certain index)
2. Remove elements (by index, by value, by index range, by value range)
3. Get element from list (by value, by index)
4. Merge 2 lists
5. Subtract one list from another
6. Making copies of list
7. Remove duplicates
8. Get list size
9. Compare 2 lists

Apart from that, overloaded basic operators and write tests that confirm that class works correctly.
